This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potentially problematic code pattern in Java related to loop termination.  The `bug.java` file showcases a `while` loop that uses a `break` statement to exit prematurely based on a specific condition.  While functional, this approach lacks robustness in larger codebases.  The `bugSolution.java` file offers an alternative, more robust method.
